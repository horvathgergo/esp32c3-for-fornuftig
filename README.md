# esp32c3-for-fornuftig
Smart controller for IKEA FÃ¶rnuftig Air Purifiers (ESP32 version)

# Hardware

New version of the fan controller is ready to test. It is based on a pure ESP32-C3. For the current PCB prototype, the FH4 version of the wifi chip was applied (with 4MB internal memory), but left space on the board for external flash too. The previous voltage regulator was also replaced with a better one. The current AP63203WU has higher frequency and requires cheaper and smaller-sized external components. More details later...
